# School_District_Analysis
Overview of the Project

The purpose of this project was to run an entire school district analysis based off of test schools in reading in math for various high schools. It was suspected that there was academic dishonesty for a specific high school, and the school board asked us to remove all the 9th grade scores from that school and compare the results to the analysis run with all the test scores.

Results of the Analysis
District summary affect
•	With removal of the 9th graders from Thomas High, there was a decrease of 461 students
•	All the test scores and averages were unaffected when it came to district averages
 

 
School summary affect
•	With removal of the 9th graders from Thomas High, the percentage of passing math dropped from a 93, down to 67.
•	The reading percentage also dropped from a 97, down to a 70
•	This drastic decrease in passing percentage would be proof enough that the scores for the 9th graders at that school were tampered with.

Effects on grade performance relative to other schools
•	Looking at the original data, Thomas High school showed passing percentages almost at the top in comparison with the other schools.
•	With their overall passing percentage being the second highest
•	When the data is modified and the 9th graders are removed however, their scores show as being almost the lowest compared to the other schools.
•	With their overall passing percentage coming in around the middle of the schools

Modded data set
 


Affects on scores by grade
•	With only the 9th graders from Thomas High School being removed, the only change made to the scores was the 9th grade column in math going from an 84 to a Nan.
•	And the reading column for Thomas High school going from an 84 to a Nan
•	No other scores or columns were affected

Scores by school spending
•	The data for school spending shows a drop of 6.5% in the percent passing Math, and a 6.9% in percent passing reading.

Scores by school size
•	Much like the school spending, the results show a drop of 5% in passing Math, and a 5.5% drop in passing reading. 
Scores by school type
•	The data for scores by school type showed a drop in passing math and passing reading by about 3%. The overall passing percentage was also lowered by 5%.
With the small amount of students removed from the data, I formulate that it was not a significant enough number to warrant any large changes in the results.

Summary
Reviewing the analysis of the school metrics after the ninth graders scores for Thomas High School was replaced with NaN 
1.	The biggest change I can see is how drastic a change happens for the Passing Math and Reading for Thomas High School once the 9th grader scores are removed. 
2.	They go from being a top 3 school in both categories and overall, to the bottom 3 in all of them.
3.	Looking at the data, the percentage of students who passed the math exam was lowered by two-tenths, while in reading it was lowered by three-tenths.
4.	Across the various metrics, there was a drop in the percent of Passing Math and Passing Reading ranging from 3% upwards to 6%.
